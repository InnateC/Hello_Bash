## Basic sctipts:
* [helloScript.sh](/helloScript.sh) uses manual functionality to print message
* [is_a_file.sh](/is_a_file.sh) check if file, you don't believe it, is a file =) 
* [renamingScript.sh](/renamingScript.sh) allow you to substitute spaces to underscore; I have a *lot* of files with spaces..
